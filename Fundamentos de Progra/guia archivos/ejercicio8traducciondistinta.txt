Tao called Tao is not Tao. 
Names can name no lasting name. 
Nameless, the origin of heaven 
and earth. 
Naming, the mother of ten 
thousand things. 
Empty of desire, perceive 
mystery. 
Filled with desire, perceive 
manifestations. 
These have the same source, but 
different names. 
Call them both Deep, Deep and 
again Deep, the gateway to all 
mystery.
